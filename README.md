This project dataset is taken from kaggle and the EDA is borrowed from one of the git repos of Laksmi A Wulandiari. 
I have used Random Forest regressor to get a better accuracy and answer business questions on the topics like sales, demand, pricing and customers. 
Using K means clustering I derived infromation about the customers to help the business understand the customer needs in a better way.
